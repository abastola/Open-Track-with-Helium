# Deploy your own Dashboard using Heroku and Github
Thanks to [GeeksForGeeks ](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-deploy-node-js-app-on-heroku-from-github/ "GeeksForGeeks ")for steps to deploy Node.js app using Heroku
1. Create Free Account on Heroku

3. Goto https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps and Click on New > Create New App

12. Now open the Setting tab scroll and look for Domain. We can see a **URL** if we copy paste and run in the browser, we can see our Deployed App. 
13. Goto https://console.helium.com/devices
14. To add a Integration, go to Integrations on the left-hand menu. Select the integration to add - in this case, the HTTP integration.
15. The next step is to paste the HTTP endpoint.
16. Copy the URL from Heroku and paste it under Endpoint URL. HTTP Header and Value are not required and those can be left blank. Lastly, provide a name for the integration. Names do not have to be unique. Click Add Integration.
17. Goto Flows > Devices
18. Drag and Drop the Device to the Dashboard
19. Goto Flows > Integrations 
20. Drag and Drop the Integration we just added to the Dashboard
21. Connect Device to Integration in the Dashboard
22. Your device should start sending location data to your Heroku app
